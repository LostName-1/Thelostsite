<h3>This is a story of the creator of the website!</h3>
<hr>
<p class="ol">In the heart of a small suburban town lived a curious young boy named Pengu. Unlike other kids his age, Pengu's fascination wasn't with sports or video games; it was with the vast expanse of the internet. His nights were spent hunched over his computer, delving into the depths of cyberspace, seeking out the obscure and the unknown.<br>

<p class="ol">
    One fateful evening, fueled by an insatiable curiosity, Pengu stumbled upon a hidden corner of the internet whispered about in hushed tones: the Dark Web. With trembling fingers, he navigated through encrypted networks and shadowy forums, uncovering secrets that made his blood run cold.<br></p>    
<p class="ol">As Pengu delved deeper, he found himself entangled in a web of illicit activities and forbidden knowledge. He witnessed the sale of drugs, weapons, and even human trafficking. But amidst the darkness, there were whispers of something more sinister—a place where the boundaries between reality and nightmare blurred, where the darkest desires of humanity found a home.<br></p>    
<p class="ol">Driven by both fear and fascination, Pengu pressed on, unable to tear himself away from the allure of the unknown. But with each click, he felt as though he was being watched, as though something malevolent lurked just beyond the screen.<br></p>   
<p class="ol">One night, as Pengu delved deeper than ever before, he stumbled upon a hidden link—an invitation to a place known only as "The Abyss." Without hesitation, he clicked, and the screen flickered to life with images that seared themselves into his mind. He watched in horror as unspeakable acts unfolded before him, unable to tear his eyes away from the screen.
              Suddenly, the room grew cold, and a sense of dread washed over him. It was then that he realized he was not alone. A presence, dark and suffocating, enveloped him, and he knew in that moment that he had ventured too far.<br></p>
<p class="ol">   As the screen went black, a single message appeared:
    
    "Welcome to The Abyss. You are next."
    
    The next day, when the police arrived at Alex's house, all they found was an empty room with a computer screen glowing ominously in the darkness. And as the reader closes the page, they can't shake the feeling that something is watching them from the shadows, waiting patiently for its next victim to stray too close to the edge.
