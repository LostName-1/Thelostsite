<h2 >Part 2(❁´◡`❁)</h2>
<hr>
<p class="ol">As Pengu's trembling fingers hovered over the keyboard, panic threatened to consume him. He had gone too far, delved too deep into the darkness of the internet, and now he was paying the price. With each passing second, the suffocating presence in the room seemed to grow stronger, its malevolence palpable in the air.<br></p>

<p class="ol">   Frantically, Pengu searched for an escape route, his mind racing as he tried to remember everything he had learned about navigating the labyrinth of the Dark Web. Every instinct screamed at him to shut down the computer and flee, but he knew it was too late for that now. The Abyss had him in its grasp, and there was no turning back.
    
  <p class="ol"> Drawing upon every ounce of courage he possessed, Pengu forced himself to focus. He couldn't afford to panic—not now, not when his life was on the line. With trembling hands, he navigated through the layers of encryption, his heart pounding in his chest as he searched for a way out.</p>
    
  <p class="ol"> And then, just when he thought all hope was lost, he stumbled upon a glimmer of light in the darkness—a hidden backdoor, concealed within the depths of the Abyss itself. It was a long shot, fraught with danger, but Pengu knew he had no other choice.<br>
    
    <p class="ol">  Without hesitating, he clicked on the link, praying silently that it would lead him to safety. For agonizing moments, the screen seemed to freeze, the silence in the room broken only by the sound of Pengu's ragged breathing. And then, with a sudden burst of static, the darkness receded, and Pengu found himself staring at the familiar glow of his desktop.</p>
    
   <p class="ol"> Relief flooded through him like a tidal wave as he realized he had escaped the clutches of the Abyss. But even as he breathed a sigh of relief, he knew that his ordeal was far from over. The darkness he had glimpsed on the Dark Web was still out there, waiting for its next victim, and Pengu knew he would never be truly safe again.<br></p>
    
    <p class="ol">With trembling hands, he shut down his computer, vowing never to return to the depths of the internet again. But as he turned to leave the room, he couldn't shake the feeling that something was watching him from the shadows, waiting patiently for its next opportunity to strike. And as he stepped out into the light of day, Pengu knew that the nightmares of the Abyss would haunt him for the rest of his days.
